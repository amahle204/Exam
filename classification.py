The visualizations reveal clear patterns in crime across South Africa. The bar chart highlights provinces with the highest total crime incidents, showing geographic disparities in crime levels. 
The histogram of incidents per 100,000 people shows how crime intensity is distributed, revealing areas with unusually high or low rates. 
The scatter plot demonstrates the relationship between population and crime rate, helping identify whether larger populations experience proportionally higher crime and highlighting potential outliers. 
The line graph illustrates crime trends over the years, uncovering seasonal patterns or spikes that are important for forecasting. 
Finally, the heatmap shows correlations between numeric variables such as population, density, and incidents, revealing which factors are strongly linked and can guide further analysis or modeling.

# Section for outliers
st.subheader("Outliers")
st.markdown("""
The analysis indicates clear outliers in the dataset, particularly in the distribution of crime incidents per 100,000 people. 
Most provinces fall within 0–50 incidents per 100,000, but a few provinces exceed 100, approaching 175, making them significant outliers. 
The scatter plot confirms this pattern, as most points cluster at lower crime rates, while a few stand out with disproportionately high rates regardless of population size. 
These outliers likely correspond to provinces such as Western Cape, Northern Cape, and Gauteng. 
Overall, the most evident outliers are provinces with incidents per 100,000 significantly above 100.

**Justification for Accuracy**  

The Random Forest classifier’s accuracy is below 90% mainly due to dataset imbalance: only 25% of observations are hotspots while 75% are non-hotspots, making high overall accuracy harder to achieve. Additionally, the available features may not capture all factors influencing hotspot status. Despite this, the model remains effective for identifying high-risk areas, as shown by precision, recall, and F1-score. The lower accuracy reflects the problem’s complexity rather than a failure of the model.
